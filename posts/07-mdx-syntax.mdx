## Headings

To create headings, use hash symbols (#) followed by a space. The number of hash symbols indicates the heading level.

> Use `h2` tags instead of `h1` tags in the post. Too many `h1` tags on a single
> page can impact SEO. The post title serves as the `h1`.

```md
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6
```

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

## Ordered Lists

3. Item 3
```

H<sub>2</sub>O
```

## Superscript

Use the `<sup>` tag to denote superscript.

```md
E=mc<sup>2</sup>
```

## Keyboard

## Task Lists

- [ ] Pass the Jedi Trials
- [ ] Train a padawan
```

- [x] Build a lightsaber
- [ ] Pass the Jedi Trials
- [ ] Train a padawan

## Tables

Use three or more hyphens (-) for the column headers and use pipes (|) to separate each column. You can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (:) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens.

```md
| Item   | Count |
| :----- | ----: |
| X-Wing |     1 |
| Y-Wing |     2 |
| A-Wing |     3 |
```

| :----- | ----: |
| X-Wing |     1 |
| Y-Wing |     2 |
| A-Wing |     3 |

---

## Footnotes

Add a caret (^) and an identifier inside brackets \(\[\^1\]\). Identifiers can be numbers or words but can't contain spaces or tabs.

```md
Here's a footnote, [^1] and here's another one. [^2]
[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^2]: This is the second footnote.
```

Here's a footnote, [^1] and here's another one. [^2]
[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^2]: This is the second footnote.

See the bottom of this page to view the footnotes.

## Code

To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

```md
code is view like `package.json` this.
```

code is view like `package.json` this.

---

## Code Blocks

Denote a code block by wrapping a section of valid code in triple backticks (`). To enable syntax highlighting, type the shorthand symbol for the language after the first three backticks. [Reference for shorthand symbols](https://shiki.style/languages).

````
```js
  function hello() {
    console.log("hello world");
  }
```
````

```js
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world");
}
```
