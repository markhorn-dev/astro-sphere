### Basics

Create a folder in the respective collection you wish to create content. The name of the folder will be the slug in which your content will be found.

```text
creating the following

/content/blog/my-new-post/index.md

will be published to

https://yourdomain.com/blog/my-new-post

```

### Frontmatter

Front matter is in yaml if you are familiar with the format. All posts and projects require frontmatter at the top of the document to be imported. All frontmatter must be inside triple dashes, similar to Astro format. See example below.

### Blog Collection

| Field   | Type    | Req? | Description                                                   |
| :------ | :------ | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| title   | string  | yes  | Title of the post. Used in SEO.                               |
| summary | string  | yes  | Short description of the post. Used in SEO.                   |
| date    | string  | yes  | Any string date that javascript can convert. Used in sorting  |
| tags    | array   | yes  | Post topic. Array of strings. Used in filtering.              |
| draft   | boolean | no   | Hides the post from collections. Unpublished entry.           |
